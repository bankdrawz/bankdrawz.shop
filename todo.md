### 1. **Implement Logic for Create User Button**
- Build a dedicated UI component for creating new users.
- Add form validation (email format, password requirements, etc.).
- Integrate API endpoint (`/api/admin/users`, POST) to handle user creation.`
- Handle backend database insertion securely (e.g., hashing passwords with bcrypt).
- Provide real-time feedback (success/error messages) on user creation.

### 2. **Force Root User Creation After Startup**
- On first server start or fresh database setup, **check if a root user exists**.
- If none exists, automatically redirect to a **mandatory root user setup page**.
- "Root" user has higher permissions than admins (full system control).
- Root account setup should require strong password policies and optionally 2FA/passkey setup immediately.

### 3. **Add Config Files for Easier Template Customization**
- Create a `config.ts` file to define:
  - App name, description
  - Default theme colors
  - Social links
  - Admin panel settings
  - Landing page text and assets
- Allow non-developers to modify branding/content without touching core code.

### 4. **Reduce Dependency on Vercel-specific Packages**
- Remove or replace packages like `@vercel/analytics`, `@vercel/storage` with platform-agnostic options.
- Ensure project runs consistently on **Vercel, AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean, or bare metal servers**.
- Choose libraries like `next-auth` (self-hosted), `prisma`, or `lucia-auth` which are platform independent.

### 5. **Implement Optional 2FA Support**
- Integrate a 2FA flow with **TOTP** (using apps like Google Authenticator, Authy).
- Add backend validation for 2FA codes during login.
- Allow users to enable/disable 2FA via settings.
- Provide backup codes for recovery in case 2FA device is lost.

### 6. **Implement Optional Passkey (WebAuthn) Support**
- Allow users to register Passkeys (Face ID, fingerprint, hardware keys like Yubikey).
- Use libraries like `@simplewebauthn/server` for backend integration.
- Update login page to support login via Passkey or traditional credentials.
- Make Passkey optional but recommended for root/admin users.

### 7. **Integrate Discord WebHooks Properly**
- Create a service to trigger Discord webhooks on:
  - New user registration
  - New API key creation
  - System alerts or errors
- Allow configuring webhook URLs and message formats in the config files.
- Ensure webhook failures don't crash main app, use retry logic.

### 8. **Add External API Access**
- Set up secure, rate-limited, token-authenticated external API routes.
- Allow users (with API keys) to interact programmatically with the application.
- Admin panel to manage API keys (generate, revoke, view usage logs).

### 9. **Expand Database-based Customization Options**
- Store more settings inside the database:
  - Themes
  - Email templates
  - Access roles & permissions
  - Feature toggles (enable/disable features without redeploying)
- Build an admin UI for managing these settings dynamically.
